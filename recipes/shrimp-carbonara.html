        <li>20 uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup skim milk</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley </li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and immediately return spaghetti to pot.</li>
            <li>While spaghetti is cooking, place shrimp in a large pan over medium heat. Add 1/2 the olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until shrimp is mostly opaque, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp to the pot of cooked and drained pasta; cover and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining olive oil in the same pan. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add milk and half-and-half; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the milk mixture into a bowl; add eggs and stir until warmed through. Pour into the pot with the shrimp and pasta and add the milk mixture. Top with Parmesan cheese and parsley.</li>
        </ol>
